## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview
XRDrone is a real-time drone-to-VR streaming and object recognition system. The project aims to build a **Unity-based application** (target: Android/Meta Quest 2) that receives **live video from a DJI Neo drone**, renders it in **immersive 3D space**, and performs **on-device object detection** to overlay visual cues such as bounding boxes, labels, or shader-based highlights.

### **Core Objectives**
- **Drone Video to Quest 2:**  
  Stream ‚â• 720p video at ‚â• 24 FPS with ‚â§ 300 ms glass-to-glass latency, rendered on a hemispherical surface to reduce distortion.
- **On-Device Vision:**  
  Detect at least two object classes (e.g., ‚Äútree,‚Äù ‚Äúperson,‚Äù ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù) in real time (‚â• 15 FPS) using optimized ML models.
- **VR User Experience:**  
  Provide a cockpit-style HUD showing stream status, detection confidence, and toggles for overlays or recentering.
- **Engineering Deliverables:**  
  Document architecture, streaming protocol rationale, model choice, benchmarking results, and safety/ethical notes.
