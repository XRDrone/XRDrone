## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview
XRDrone is a real-time drone-to-VR system for fire-rescue scenarios that streams live video from a DJI Neo into a Meta Quest headset, runs on-device detection for **fire, smoke, and humans**, and renders results as **3D spatial overlays** with a cockpit-style HUD. The goal is to improve situational awareness by showing **where** detections are in space, not just **that** they exist. The app targets **single-operator** use on standalone VR hardware and excludes autonomous flight control and long-term cloud storage by default.

### Core Objectives
- **Video ‚Üí Quest (Performance & Latency):**  
  Stream **‚â•720p** at **‚â•24 FPS** with **‚â§2% dropped frames** (3-min test), **‚â§300 ms median glass-to-glass latency**, and render on a **curved surface** to minimize distortion.
- **On-Device Vision (Classes & Quality):**  
  Run **edge inference on Quest** at **‚â•15 FPS** for **fire/smoke/human**; achieve **F1 ‚â• 0.5** on **‚â•150** evaluation frames relevant to forest-fire scenes.
- **Spatial Overlays & HUD (UX):**  
  Show **3D-aligned overlays** that convey **altitude** and **lateral position**; HUD displays **FPS, latency, detection confidence, and drone battery**; visually **de-emphasize low-confidence** detections.
- **Reliability & Safety:**  
  **Recover from forced disconnect** without app restart and **operate ‚â•5 minutes** without crashes or severe FPS drops.
- **Privacy & Ethics:**  
  **No PII stored by default**; any recording is **explicit opt-in** with a confirmation dialog and consent timestamping.
- **Engineering Deliverables:**  
  Clear **architecture**, **measurement methods** (latency/FPS/inference), **profiling & logs**, and a **reproducible build**.

| REQ-003 (NFR-Performance) | **‚â§ 300 ms median** glass-to-glass latency (**‚â§ 400 ms p95**) | Must | Measured via timestamp overlay + external camera; report median & p95 |
| REQ-004 (NFR-Performance) | On-device detection (fire/smoke/human) at **‚â• 15 FPS** on Quest | Must | On-device profiling shows sustained ‚â• 15 inference FPS |
| REQ-005 (NFR-Quality) | **F1 ‚â• 0.5** on **‚â• 150** labeled evaluation frames (fire-scene relevant) | Must | Standard precision/recall evaluation report |
| REQ-006 (NFR-Privacy/Ethics) | **No PII stored by default**; any recording is **explicit opt-in** and **license-compliant** | Must | Runtime shows recording **off** by default; enabling requires clear UI toggle + confirmation dialog; consent **timestamped**; no user-identifiable data logged unless consent; note dataset-license compliance (Fire & Smoke, CrowdHuman) |
| REQ-007 | Render **spatial overlays** that convey **altitude** and **lateral position** | Must | Live VR demo shows correct 3D placement with visible altitude/lateral indicators; ‚â• 3 object types; verified by reference marker/external ground truth |
| REQ-008 | HUD shows **FPS, latency, detection confidence, drone battery** | Should | Each value updates ‚â• 1/s, remains visible without obstructing video |
| REQ-009 | **Low-confidence** detections are visually differentiated | Should | Detections with confidence < threshold (default 0.5 unless user-adjusted) use distinct styling (e.g., dashed/faded); demonstrate ‚â• 2 levels |
| REQ-010 (NFR-Reliability/Stability) | **‚â• 5 min** continuous operation; **no crashes**; FPS never **< 20** | Should | Performance log shows stable CPU/GPU, zero fatal errors |
